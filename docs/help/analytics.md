(ill make this prettier later)

This pack collects data on how many active clients or servers use it. We however do NOT collect any personal information, system information or any other than just "Youre currently playing" and the version you are on and if you are a Client or Server.

This is just for me to have a better sense on whats going on and i like stats and graphs, i have no real interest in anything else, if you however feel uncomfortable with that, you can simply remove the mod "[Pack Analytics](https://modrinth.com/mod/pack-analytics)".

Click on the link you can see for yourself that its simply a ping of "hey im currently playing client/server on version XXX" and nothing more.
